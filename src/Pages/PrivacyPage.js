                If you request the removal of certain information, it will be

                information may be stored indefinitely in "backup" systems or
                log files due to technical, physical, or legal requirements.
                Therefore, do not always expect us to remove personal
                identification information from the database in response to your
                request.

                Travel may use tracking records, invisible screen pixels, and
                functional beacons to gather information about you during your
                website visit. The tracking record is a small text file sent
                from the server to your browser and stored on the hard drive of
                your computer, providing your computer with a unique
                identification card upon returning to the website.
